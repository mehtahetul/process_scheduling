# Process Scheduling Simulation and Calculator
This project is a website that simulates various Process Scheduling Algorithms (FCFS , SJF , SRTF , RR) using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

# Process Scheduling Algorithms
FCFS (First-Come, First-Served): This non-preemptive algorithm schedules processes in the order they arrive in the ready queue, without prioritizing based on any other factors.
SJF (Shortest Job First): This algorithm selects the process with the shortest burst time first, aiming to minimize average waiting time.
SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First): A preemptive version of SJF, it selects the process with the shortest remaining execution time, potentially preempting the current running process if a shorter job arrives.
RR (Round Robin): This preemptive algorithm assigns a fixed time quantum to each process in the ready queue, cycling through them to ensure fair CPU time distribution.
